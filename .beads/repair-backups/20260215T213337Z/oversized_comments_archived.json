Added Arc<AtomicBool>-based WatchWaiter dedup (matching mpsc/broadcast pattern). Added 2 regression tests: no_unbounded_waker_growth, cancel_and_recreate_bounded_waiters.\n\n2. watch.rs: Fixed misleading comment on receiver_count initialization.\n\n3. mpsc.rs: Audited - waker dedup is correct. No issues found.\n\n4. broadcast.rs: Audited - same correct dedup pattern as mpsc. No issues found.\n\n5. oneshot.rs: Audited - simple single-waker design, no growth concern.\n\nAll quality gates pass: check, clippy -D warnings, fmt, tests (26/26 watch tests pass).",

No bugs.\n- runtime/waker.rs: WakerState with Mutex<Vec<TaskId>> dedup via linear scan (O(n)). Acceptable for lab/test path (production uses three_lane WakeState). No bugs.\n- runtime/deadline_monitor.rs: Adaptive threshold monitoring with percentile-based DurationHistory. Proper borrow management for HashMap entry + warning emission. No bugs.\n- obligation/leak_check.rs: Static analyzer with 5-state lattice (Empty/Held/Resolved/MayHold/MayHoldAmbiguous). All 25 join combinations correct. Monotonic lattice semantics verified. No bugs.\n- sync/pool.rs: Resource pool with FIFO waiter queue, health checking, obligation-based return tracking. Minor metric issue: total_acquisitions temporarily inflated during health check window in try_get_idle (LOW - correct net effect). No correctness bugs.\n- obligation/recovery.rs: Recovery governor with CRDT lattice semantics. Agent flagged 3 'critical' findings - ALL FALSE POSITIVES (single-threaded code, CRDT monotonicity prevents resurrection). No bugs.\n- obligation/marking.rs: VASS marking analyzer. Fixed hardcoded ObligationKind list (lines 757-762) to use ALL_KINDS constant. Snapshot timeline is O(N*K) - acceptable for analysis tool.\n\nFIX APPLIED: marking.rs line 757 - replaced hardcoded [SendPermit, Ack, Lease, IoOp] with ALL_KINDS constant to prevent future maintenance bugs if new ObligationKind variants are added.

Under concurrent load, N tasks can all pass the check simultaneously, all create resources, and all call record_acquisition(), causing active to exceed max_size.\n\nImpact: Pool over-provisions beyond configured max_size. Self-correcting (subsequent can_create() calls see the inflated count), but violates the active + idle <= max_size invariant temporarily.\n\nFix: Speculatively increment active (or a creating counter) inside can_create() before releasing the lock. On factory failure, decrement. This is the standard async pool pattern.\n\n### Finding 2: total_acquisitions decrement (KNOWN - previously reported)\nSeverity: Low | Line 1221\n\nWhen health check fails on an idle resource, total_acquisitions is decremented via saturating_sub(1). The field is documented as Total acquisitions since pool creation (line 337) - a monotone counter. Decrementing breaks monotonicity for external observers doing periodic sampling.\n\n### Finding 3: Redundant unsafe impl Send (STYLE)\nSeverity: None (correctness ok) | Lines 516-517\n\nPooledResource has unsafe impl Send. All fields (Option R, ReturnObligation bool, mpsc Sender, Instant) auto-derive Send when R: Send. The manual impl is unnecessary but harmless.\n\n### Finding 4: Crate uses deny not forbid\nlib.rs line 50: deny(unsafe_code) - MEMORY.md previously stated forbid. The allow(unsafe_code) on pool.rs line 516 is valid because deny can be overridden by allow (forbid cannot).\n\n### Verdict: 1 new bug (TOCTOU), 1 known issue, 2 informational.

Thread B: notify_one() acquires lock, scans entries, finds no waiters, drops lock (line 165)\n4. Thread B: increments stored_notifications (line 166) -> now 1\n5. Thread A: acquires lock, registers waiter at index i, drops lock, returns Pending\n\nResult: stored_notifications = 1, waiter registered but never woken. Future hangs permanently.\n\nRoot cause: stored_notifications is incremented OUTSIDE the lock in notify_one (line 165-166), but the check happens BEFORE the lock in poll (line 247). No serialization between the two paths.\n\nAdditionally, the Waiting state (lines 293-330) never re-checks stored_notifications, so even if the future were spuriously re-polled, it wouldn't find the stored notification.\n\nFix (two-part):\n1. In notify_one: move stored_notifications.fetch_add inside the lock (before drop(waiters))\n2. In poll Init: re-check stored_notifications AFTER acquiring the lock, before registering the waiter. If stored > 0, CAS decrement and return Ready.\n\nThis ensures: either notify_one sees our waiter (notifies directly) or we see its stored notification (consume it).\n\n### WaiterSlab design: SOUND\n- Slot reuse via free_slots prevents unbounded Vec growth\n- Tail shrinking correctly preserves notified entries (notified=true prevents shrinking)\n- Tests verify no-growth invariant under repeated cancel cycles\n\n### notify_waiters: SOUND\n- Generation-based approach avoids the stored_notifications race (generation is checked locklessly and is monotone)\n- Wakers collected under lock, woken after lock release (correct)\n\n### Verdict: 1 HIGH severity lost-wakeup bug.

Permits are available but not distributed.\n\nFix: Add the same cascading wakeup block to OwnedAcquireFuture::poll after the successful acquire path (line 490, before the return).\n\n### Design: SOUND otherwise\n- FIFO fairness: try_acquire rejects when queue non-empty (no queue jumping)\n- Cancel/drop: front-waiter delegation (wakes next) prevents lost wakeups\n- add_permits: correctly wakes front waiter only (chain propagates via acquire-success wakeup... except for the OwnedAcquireFuture path)\n- OwnedSemaphorePermit::try_acquire: correctly uses mem::forget to prevent double-release\n\n### Verdict: 1 MEDIUM bug (missing cascading wakeup in OwnedAcquireFuture).

Otherwise woken writers/readers would block on the still-held std lock.\n\n2. **Baton-passing** in ReadFuture::Drop (477-503): If dequeued by drain_reader_waiters but dropped without acquiring, wakes a writer if readers==0 && writer_waiters>0.\n\n3. **Baton-passing** in WriteFuture::Drop (600-644): If dequeued by pop_writer_waiter but dropped without acquiring, wakes next writer. Also drains reader_waiters when writer_waiters reaches 0 (critical: unblocks readers when last pending writer cancels).\n\n4. **writer_waiters counting**: Increment on first poll (counted=false→true), decrement on acquire (counted back to false) or drop (if counted). Never double-decremented.\n\n5. **can_acquire logic** (line 536-537): `!writer_active && readers == 0 && (dequeued || writer_waiters == 1)`. FIFO among writers: only the dequeued waiter or the sole waiter can acquire.\n\n6. **Owned variants** (OwnedRwLockReadGuard, OwnedRwLockWriteGuard): Don't hold StdRwLock guards; use with_read/with_write for ad-hoc access. State tracking (readers count / writer_active) prevents concurrent access. This is safe because all acquisition paths check the state before accessing the StdRwLock.\n\n7. **Poisoning consistency**: Flag set during panic before StdRwLock guard drops, so by the time release_reader/release_writer runs, the flag is set.\n\n### Test coverage: Good\n- Multiple readers, write exclusion, writer-blocks-readers, cancellation during read/write wait, try_read/try_write, guard release on drop, get_mut, into_inner.\n",

Concurrent acquires could both pass check and exceed max_size.\n- Additional risk: if acquire future was dropped/cancelled while create_resource().await was in progress, capacity accounting could leak because nothing decremented pending creation state.\n- Fix: added creation-slot accounting (`creating`) and drop-safe `CreateSlotReservation` RAII guard.\n  - Wait path now considers `active + idle + creating` when deciding readiness.\n  - reserve/release/commit helpers enforce capacity at reservation time and release slot on cancellation/error via Drop.\n  - removed old post-create `record_acquisition` path.\n- Warmup fix in same file: cap warmup target by available capacity (`max_size - existing`) so warmup never exceeds configured max_size.\n\n2) src/runtime/blocking_pool.rs — shutdown contract violation on spawn.\n- Root cause: `spawn_with_priority` accepted/enqueued tasks even after `shutdown()`, despite docs claiming new tasks are rejected.\n- Fix: in both `BlockingPool` and `BlockingPoolHandle` paths, if shutdown is set then return an immediate cancelled+done handle (never enqueue work).\n\nRegression tests added:\n- sync::pool::tests::create_slot_reservation_enforces_max_size_and_releases_on_drop\n- sync::pool::tests::warmup_respects_max_size\n- runtime::blocking_pool::tests::spawn_after_shutdown_is_rejected\n- runtime::blocking_pool::tests::handle_spawn_after_shutdown_is_rejected\n\nValidation run:\n- rustfmt --edition 2021 src/sync/pool.rs src/runtime/blocking_pool.rs\n- cargo fmt --check (pass)\n- CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/asupersync-topaz-2 cargo check --lib (pass)\n- CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/asupersync-topaz-2 cargo check --all-targets (pass)\n- CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/asupersync-topaz-2 cargo test --lib create_slot_reservation_enforces_max_size_and_releases_on_drop -- --nocapture (pass)\n- CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/asupersync-topaz-2 cargo test --lib warmup_respects_max_size -- --nocapture (pass)\n- CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/asupersync-topaz-2 cargo test --lib spawn_after_shutdown_is_rejected -- --nocapture (pass; covers both spawn-after-shutdown tests)\n- CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/asupersync-topaz-2 cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings (fails on unrelated existing lint in src/sync/rwlock.rs:983 `clippy::useless-let-if-seq`).\n\nCoordination note:\n- Detected compile error in src/sync/semaphore.rs during validation, but BlackFinch already held exclusive reservation; I released my temporary reservation and did not edit that file.\n",

Under concurrent load, N tasks can all pass the check simultaneously, all create resources, and all call record_acquisition(), causing active to exceed max_size.\n\nImpact: Pool over-provisions beyond configured max_size. Self-correcting (subsequent can_create() calls see the inflated count), but violates the active + idle <= max_size invariant temporarily.\n\nFix: Speculatively increment active (or a creating counter) inside can_create() before releasing the lock. On factory failure, decrement. This is the standard async pool pattern.\n\n### Finding 2: total_acquisitions decrement (KNOWN - previously reported)\nSeverity: Low | Line 1221\n\nWhen health check fails on an idle resource, total_acquisitions is decremented via saturating_sub(1). The field is documented as Total acquisitions since pool creation (line 337) - a monotone counter. Decrementing breaks monotonicity for external observers doing periodic sampling.\n\n### Finding 3: Redundant unsafe impl Send (STYLE)\nSeverity: None (correctness ok) | Lines 516-517\n\nPooledResource has unsafe impl Send. All fields (Option R, ReturnObligation bool, mpsc Sender, Instant) auto-derive Send when R: Send. The manual impl is unnecessary but harmless.\n\n### Finding 4: Crate uses deny not forbid\nlib.rs line 50: deny(unsafe_code) - MEMORY.md previously stated forbid. The allow(unsafe_code) on pool.rs line 516 is valid because deny can be overridden by allow (forbid cannot).\n\n### Verdict: 1 new bug (TOCTOU), 1 known issue, 2 informational.

Thread B: notify_one() acquires lock, scans entries, finds no waiters, drops lock (line 165)\n4. Thread B: increments stored_notifications (line 166) -> now 1\n5. Thread A: acquires lock, registers waiter at index i, drops lock, returns Pending\n\nResult: stored_notifications = 1, waiter registered but never woken. Future hangs permanently.\n\nRoot cause: stored_notifications is incremented OUTSIDE the lock in notify_one (line 165-166), but the check happens BEFORE the lock in poll (line 247). No serialization between the two paths.\n\nAdditionally, the Waiting state (lines 293-330) never re-checks stored_notifications, so even if the future were spuriously re-polled, it wouldn't find the stored notification.\n\nFix (two-part):\n1. In notify_one: move stored_notifications.fetch_add inside the lock (before drop(waiters))\n2. In poll Init: re-check stored_notifications AFTER acquiring the lock, before registering the waiter. If stored > 0, CAS decrement and return Ready.\n\nThis ensures: either notify_one sees our waiter (notifies directly) or we see its stored notification (consume it).\n\n### WaiterSlab design: SOUND\n- Slot reuse via free_slots prevents unbounded Vec growth\n- Tail shrinking correctly preserves notified entries (notified=true prevents shrinking)\n- Tests verify no-growth invariant under repeated cancel cycles\n\n### notify_waiters: SOUND\n- Generation-based approach avoids the stored_notifications race (generation is checked locklessly and is monotone)\n- Wakers collected under lock, woken after lock release (correct)\n\n### Verdict: 1 HIGH severity lost-wakeup bug.

Also drains reader_waiters when writer_waiters reaches 0 (critical: unblocks readers when last pending writer cancels).\n\n4. **writer_waiters counting**: Increment on first poll (counted=false→true), decrement on acquire (counted back to false) or drop (if counted).

State tracking (readers count / writer_active) prevents concurrent access.

Concurrent acquires could both pass check and exceed max_size.\n- Additional risk: if acquire future was dropped/cancelled while create_resource().await was in progress, capacity accounting could leak because nothing decremented pending creation state.\n- Fix: added creation-slot accounting (`creating`) and drop-safe `CreateSlotReservation` RAII guard.\n  - Wait path now considers `active + idle + creating` when deciding readiness.\n  - reserve/release/commit helpers enforce capacity at reservation time and release slot on cancellation/error via Drop.\n  - removed old post-create `record_acquisition` path.\n- Warmup fix in same file: cap warmup target by available capacity (`max_size - existing`) so warmup never exceeds configured max_size.\n\n2) src/runtime/blocking_pool.rs — shutdown contract violation on spawn.\n- Root cause: `spawn_with_priority` accepted/enqueued tasks even after `shutdown()`, despite docs claiming new tasks are rejected.\n- Fix: in both `BlockingPool` and `BlockingPoolHandle` paths, if shutdown is set then return an immediate cancelled+done handle (never enqueue work).\n\nRegression tests added:\n- sync::pool::tests::create_slot_reservation_enforces_max_size_and_releases_on_drop\n- sync::pool::tests::warmup_respects_max_size\n- runtime::blocking_pool::tests::spawn_after_shutdown_is_rejected\n- runtime::blocking_pool::tests::handle_spawn_after_shutdown_is_rejected\n\nValidation run:\n- rustfmt --edition 2021 src/sync/pool.rs src/runtime/blocking_pool.rs\n- cargo fmt --check (pass)\n- CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/asupersync-topaz-2 cargo check --lib (pass)\n- CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/asupersync-topaz-2 cargo check --all-targets (pass)\n- CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/asupersync-topaz-2 cargo test --lib create_slot_reservation_enforces_max_size_and_releases_on_drop -- --nocapture (pass)\n- CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/asupersync-topaz-2 cargo test --lib warmup_respects_max_size -- --nocapture (pass)\n- CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/asupersync-topaz-2 cargo test --lib spawn_after_shutdown_is_rejected -- --nocapture (pass; covers both spawn-after-shutdown tests)\n- CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/asupersync-topaz-2 cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings (fails on unrelated existing lint in src/sync/rwlock.rs:983 `clippy::useless-let-if-seq`).\n\nCoordination note:\n- Detected compile error in src/sync/semaphore.rs during validation, but BlackFinch already held exclusive reservation; I released my temporary reservation and did not edit that file.\n",
