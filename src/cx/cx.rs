//! The capability context type.
//!
//! `Cx` is the token that grants access to runtime capabilities:
//! - Querying identity (region ID, task ID)
//! - Checking cancellation status
//! - Yielding and sleeping
//! - Tracing
//!
//! # Capability Model
//!
//! All effectful operations in Asupersync flow through explicit `Cx` tokens.
//! This design prevents ambient authority and enables:
//!
//! - **Effect interception**: Production vs lab runtime can interpret effects differently
//! - **Cancellation propagation**: Cx carries cancellation signals through the task tree
//! - **Budget enforcement**: Deadlines and poll quotas flow through Cx
//! - **Observability**: Tracing and spans are tied to task identity
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! `Cx` is `Send + Sync` due to its internal `Arc<RwLock>`. However, the semantic
//! contract is that a `Cx` is associated with a specific task and should not be
//! shared across task boundaries. The runtime manages Cx lifetime and ensures
//! each task receives its own context.
//!
//! # Wrapping Cx for Frameworks
//!
//! Framework authors (e.g., fastapi_rust) should wrap `Cx` rather than store it directly:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // CORRECT: Wrap Cx reference, delegate capabilities
//! pub struct RequestContext<'a> {
//!     cx: &'a Cx,
//!     request: &'a Request,
//!     // framework-specific fields
//! }
//!
//! impl<'a> RequestContext<'a> {
//!     pub fn check_cancelled(&self) -> bool {
//!         self.cx.is_cancel_requested()
//!     }
//!
//!     pub fn budget(&self) -> Budget {
//!         self.cx.budget()
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This pattern ensures:
//! - Cx lifetime is tied to the request scope
//! - Framework can add domain-specific context
//! - All capabilities flow through the wrapped Cx

/// The capability context for a task.
///
/// `Cx` provides access to runtime capabilities within Asupersync. All effectful
/// operations flow through `Cx`, ensuring explicit capability security with no
/// ambient authority.
///
/// # Overview
///
/// A `Cx` instance is provided to each task by the runtime. It grants access to:
///
/// - **Identity**: Query the current region and task IDs
/// - **Budget**: Check remaining time/poll quotas
/// - **Cancellation**: Observe and respond to cancellation requests
/// - **Tracing**: Emit trace events for observability
///
/// # Usage for External Crates
///
/// External crates like fastapi_rust can depend on Asupersync and use `Cx`:
///
/// ```ignore
/// use asupersync::Cx;
///
/// async fn handle_request(cx: &Cx) -> Result<Response, Error> {
///     // Check if the request should be cancelled
///     if cx.is_cancel_requested() {
///         return Err(Error::Cancelled);
///     }
///
///     // Check remaining budget (timeout)
///     let budget = cx.budget();
///     if budget.is_expired() {
///         return Err(Error::Timeout);
///     }
///
///     // Trace request handling
///     cx.trace("Processing request");
///
///     // Do work...
///     Ok(Response::new())
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Cloning
///
/// `Cx` is cheaply clonable (it wraps an `Arc`). Clones share the same
/// underlying state, so cancellation signals and budget updates are visible
/// to all clones.
///
/// # Lifetime Considerations
///
/// While `Cx` can be cloned and moved, it semantically belongs to a specific
/// task within a specific region. The runtime ensures proper cleanup when
/// tasks complete.
