//! Polynomial Functor Composition Laws for Phase 0 Combinators.
//!
//! This module serves as the formal **law sheet** for asupersync's combinator
//! algebra, documenting every algebraic law that Phase 0 commits to preserving.
//! Future phases (polynomial functor rewrites, streaming pipelines, distributed
//! scheduling) must not violate these laws.
//!
//! # Categorical Perspective
//!
//! Asupersync's combinators can be viewed through polynomial functors where:
//! - **Objects** are outcome-producing computations `F : 1 → Outcome<T,E>`
//! - **Join** is a product-like operation (wait for all, take worst severity)
//! - **Race** is a coproduct-like operation (take first, cancel rest)
//! - **Timeout** is a deadline comonad (tighten time budget, collapse nested)
//! - **Pipeline** is Kleisli composition (sequence stages, short-circuit errors)
//! - **Quorum** interpolates between join and race (M-of-N)
//!
//! The severity lattice `Ok < Err < Cancelled < Panicked` forms a bounded
//! join-semilattice under `join_outcomes`. Budget combination forms a
//! commutative monoid with `INFINITE` as identity.
//!
//! # Law Classification
//!
//! Each law is classified as:
//!
//! - **Unconditional**: Holds for all inputs, regardless of scheduling policy,
//!   timing, or runtime configuration. These are structural guarantees.
//!
//! - **Conditional on Policy**: Holds only when certain runtime policies are
//!   active (e.g., short-circuit vs continue-on-error, winner selection).
//!
//! - **Conditional on Timing**: Holds only given specific timing relationships
//!   between operations (e.g., hedge degenerates depend on whether primary
//!   beats the deadline).

//! ## Severity Lattice (Unconditional)
//!
//! | Law | Statement | Classification |
//! |-----|-----------|----------------|
//! | SEV-ORDER | `Ok < Err < Cancelled < Panicked` | Unconditional |
//! | SEV-BOUNDED | `∀ o: Ok ≤ severity(o) ≤ Panicked` | Unconditional |
//!
//! ## Join Laws (Unconditional)
//!
//! | Law | Statement | Classification |
//! |-----|-----------|----------------|
//! | JOIN-COMM | `severity(join(a,b)) = severity(join(b,a))` | Unconditional |
//! | JOIN-ASSOC | `severity(join(join(a,b),c)) = severity(join(a,join(b,c)))` | Unconditional |
//! | JOIN-IDEM | `severity(join(a,a)) = severity(a)` | Unconditional |
//! | JOIN-UNIT | `severity(join(Ok,a)) = severity(a)` | Unconditional |
//! | JOIN-ABSORB | `severity(join(Panicked,a)) = Panicked` | Unconditional |

//!
//! This distributivity law holds at the severity level but NOT at the value
//! level, because the concrete winner in a race depends on scheduling order.

//! | CANCEL-ASSOC | `strengthen(strengthen(a,b),c) = strengthen(a,strengthen(b,c))` | Unconditional |
//! | CANCEL-MONOTONE | `severity(a.strengthen(b)) ≥ severity(a)` | Unconditional |
//! | CANCEL-MAX | `a.strengthen(b).kind = max(a.kind, b.kind)` by PartialOrd | Unconditional |
//!
//! ## Quorum Degeneracies (Unconditional by construction)
//!
//! | Law | Statement | Classification |
//! |-----|-----------|----------------|
//! | QUORUM-JOIN | `quorum(N, N, [f1..fN]) ≃ join_all([f1..fN])` | Unconditional |
//! | QUORUM-RACE | `quorum(1, N, [f1..fN]) ≃ race_all([f1..fN])` in success semantics | Unconditional |
//! | QUORUM-ZERO | `quorum(0, N, [..]) → Ok([])` immediately | Unconditional |
//!
//! ## Hedge Degeneracies (Conditional on Timing)
//!
//! | Law | Statement | Classification |
//! |-----|-----------|----------------|
//! | HEDGE-FAST | If primary completes before deadline: `hedge ≃ primary` | Conditional on timing |
//! | HEDGE-SLOW | If primary exceeds deadline: `hedge ≃ race(primary, backup)` | Conditional on timing |
//! | HEDGE-DRAIN | Loser is always cancelled and drained | Unconditional (invariant) |
//!
//! ## Pipeline Laws (Conditional on Error Policy)
//!
//! | Law | Statement | Classification |
//! |-----|-----------|----------------|
//! | PIPELINE-SEQ | Stages execute sequentially: output(N) = input(N+1) | Unconditional |
//! | PIPELINE-SHORT | First non-Ok stage terminates pipeline | Conditional on `continue_on_error = false` |
//! | PIPELINE-ASSOC | `pipeline(a, pipeline(b, c)) ≃ pipeline(pipeline(a, b), c)` | Conditional on error policy |
//!
//! ## First-Ok Laws
//!
//! | Law | Statement | Classification |
//! |-----|-----------|----------------|
//! | FIRST-OK-FOUND | First Ok result wins, remaining stages skipped | Unconditional |
//! | FIRST-OK-ALL-FAIL | All non-Ok → worst severity returned | Unconditional |
//!
//! ## Structural Invariants (Unconditional)
//!
//! | Invariant | Statement |
//! |-----------|-----------|
//! | NO-ABANDON | Child tasks are never left dangling |
//! | LOSER-DRAIN | In race/timeout/hedge/quorum, losers are cancelled AND awaited |
//! | REGION-QUIESCENCE | All children complete before parent region closes |
//! | CANCEL-PROPAGATION | Parent cancellation propagates to all descendants |
//!
//! # Preservation Constraints for Future Phases
//!
//! When implementing polynomial functor rewrites or distributed scheduling:
//!
//! 1. **Do not break severity-level commutativity/associativity of join.**
//!    These are the core lattice laws.
//!
//! 2. **Do not break timeout-min composition.**
//!    Nested timeout collapsing is relied on for deadline inheritance.
//!
//! 3. **Do not break the loser-drain invariant.**
//!    Resource safety depends on it.
//!
//! 4. **Race-join distributivity is severity-only.**
//!    Do not assume value-level distributivity.
//!
//! 5. **Quorum degeneracies must hold by construction.**
//!    quorum(N,N) = join and quorum(1,N) ≃ race are definitional.
