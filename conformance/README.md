# asupersync-conformance

`asupersync-conformance` provides fixtures and checks for validating async
runtime behavior against the asupersync conformance expectations.

## Purpose

This crate is intended for conformance testing and report generation used by
the asupersync project and compatible runtime implementations.

It also exposes machine-readable coverage tooling for formal proof tracking:
- `traceability` for spec-to-test mappings
- `lean_coverage_matrix` for Lean proof coverage ontology/matrix validation
